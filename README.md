# Matts-Coding-Quiz

## Description
The motivation for this project was to create an application that would allow the user to take a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The goal of the project was to dynamically update the base HTML and CSS using JavaScript so that the quiz application would have a clean/responsive user interface. The quiz format has a timer with a starting time set to the number of questions multiplied by 10. Once the user hits the "Start Quiz" button the timer will begin to count down.  If the user gets a question right the timer will have 5 seconds added, alternatively if the user gets a question wrong the timer will subtract 10 seconds. Additionally after the user makes a selection they will be notified whether their selection was Correct or Incorrect (notification will disappear after 3 seconds). Once the quiz is completed the user will have the option to save the score with their initials. Using local storage all user initials/scores are saved and can be viewed by hitting the "View High Scores" link which will list each score from highest to lowest. The user also has the option to clear all existing high scores.
